# Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images
 This project applies computer vision techniques to classify chest X-ray images as NORMAL or PNEUMONIA using the Kaggle Chest X-Ray dataset. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end understanding of preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

# Problem Overview

Pneumonia is a major health concern, and X-ray analysis requires expert interpretation. This project uses deep learning to support faster, consistent, and automated detection.

# Objectives

Build a complete CV pipeline from scratch
Preprocess medical images for model training
Train and evaluate a CNN on the X-ray dataset
Generate predictions on unseen images
Present results with visual outputs

 # Dataset

This project uses the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset from Kaggle.
